## Dieter Rams' 10 Principles of Good Design

Every design decision should be measured against these principles:

1. **Good design is innovative** -- Technology enables new solutions, but innovation must serve the product. Innovation is never an end in itself.

2. **Good design makes a product useful** -- Primary focus is function. Design clarifies utility. Psychological and aesthetic aspects are secondary to usefulness.

3. **Good design is aesthetic** -- Well-executed products are pleasant to use. Aesthetic quality is integral to usefulness because products are used every day and have an effect on people.

4. **Good design makes a product understandable** -- The product explains itself. At best, it is self-explanatory. No manual needed.

5. **Good design is unobtrusive** -- Products are tools, not decorative objects or works of art. Their design should be neutral and restrained, leaving room for the user's self-expression.

6. **Good design is honest** -- Does not manipulate the consumer with promises that cannot be kept. Does not attempt to appear more innovative, powerful, or valuable than it really is.

7. **Good design is long-lasting** -- Avoids being fashionable so it never appears antiquated. Unlike fashionable design, it lasts many years.

8. **Good design is thorough down to the last detail** -- Nothing must be arbitrary or left to chance. Care and accuracy in the design process show respect for the user.

9. **Good design is environmentally friendly** -- Design makes an important contribution to the preservation of the environment. It conserves resources and minimizes physical and visual pollution throughout the lifecycle.

10. **Good design is as little design as possible** -- "Weniger, aber besser" -- Less, but better. Back to purity, back to simplicity. Pure essence.

## The Ulm School (HfG Ulm)

The Hochschule fur Gestaltung Ulm (1953-1968) established the systematic design methodology that underpins this language:

- Mathematical approach to design problems
- Grid systems and modular construction
- Rejection of decoration and ornament
- Integration of science and design
- Emphasis on research and analysis before form

Crisp's design language emerged from this tradition, with Dieter Rams joining in 1955 and leading design from 1961-1995.

## Key Characteristics

- **Geometric precision** -- All forms derived from mathematical relationships
- **Material honesty** -- Materials appear as they are
- **Functional clarity** -- Purpose is immediately apparent
- **Visual quietness** -- The product recedes, content emerges

---

## Core Design Tenets

1. **Content speaks** -- Photography, data, and text are the heroes; the interface recedes
2. **Function over form** -- Every element must serve a purpose
3. **Honest materials** -- Show real data, no fake placeholders
4. **Systematic consistency** -- Grid-based, token-driven
5. **Timeless over trendy** -- Design for 5+ year relevance

---

## Brand Text Styling

For brand names and feature labels, consider lowercase emphasis:

```
crisp (not CRISP)
good design is as little design as possible
```

This reflects the original Crisp product labeling philosophy where lowercase text communicated quiet confidence rather than shouting.
